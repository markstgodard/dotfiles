# My dot files

![dotfiles](http://gph.is/1O3sBNM)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these are mine.

Actually these are my personal dot files for Vim, Tmux, Git and zsh


Thanks and credit due to [@chrishunt](https://github.com/chrishunt/dot-files) as I used some of his config for the basis
of my dotfiles.
